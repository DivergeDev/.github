## Our Vision  

At Diverge, we believe technology should **work for people**, not the other way around.  
Our mission is to design an **AI-powered lifestyle automation system** that motivates, supports, and empowers individuals to live healthier, more intentional lives.  

In today’s world, many people feel trapped in addictive scrolling habits. Diverge is reimagining how technology can act as a guide—encouraging exploration, self-improvement, and balance instead of overconsumption.

## Zstyle: The Lifestyle Framework  

Our research centers on a framework we call **Zstyle**: an ecosystem of AI agents that collaborate to support every aspect of life. These agents integrate with existing tools and applications, creating a single intelligent system that adapts to each individual’s needs.  

**Agents include:**  
- **Zstyle Assistant Agent** – Organizes tasks, integrates with productivity tools, and acts as the central hub for lifestyle management.  
- **Nutritionist Agent** – Supports meal planning, healthy eating, and recipe management.  
- **Trainer/Coach Agent** – Designs adaptive fitness plans that align with user schedules and health data.  
- **Future Agents** – Additional specialists in health, wellness, creativity, and productivity are in development.

These agents communicate with each other, share insights, and **guide users toward their goals**—whether that’s improving health, building better habits, or achieving personal milestones.

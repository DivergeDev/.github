## About Us

Diverge is a purpose driven startup committed to building a safe, inclusive, and empowering social platform for individuals with disabilities. Our mission is to provide a digital space where users can connect, share experiences, and access tools designed to enhance their independence, confidence, and quality of life.

We believe that disability does not define a person and we aim to help individuals diverge from the limiting narratives often imposed by society. Through thoughtful design and cutting-edge assistive technology, Diverge creates an environment where users feel respected, supported, and in control of their own journey.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to use technology and AI tools to improve social and everyday life for people with disabilities because being disabled shouldn’t mean being disconnected. At the same time, we aim to take what we learn from user experiences and future revenue to support research that helps improve and create new tools, both digital and physical, including innovations like more accessible and empowering prosthetic devices.

## Why "Diverge"?

The name *Diverge* comes from the idea that we don’t all have to follow the same path and that’s okay. Being different isn’t something to hide. It's something to celebrate. This platform is for people who want to take a different route and still feel connected, respected, and in control of their own story.
